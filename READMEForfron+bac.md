# React_js_basics
Basics of react js for begineers
Here we are creating a basic project in which we will sort the bottles based upon the size that is medium,large or small
For the front end we are using the React JS and for backend we are using the Spring boot(Java framework).
Also for connecting the React with Server we are using the http client
For removing the parent and child dependecies of state and data I am using the Redux also in the project
